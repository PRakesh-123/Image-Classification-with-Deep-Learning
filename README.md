Image classification is the process of assigning classes to images. This is done by finding similar features in images belonging to different classes and using them to identify and label images. Image classification is done with the help of neural networks. Neural networks are deep learning algorithms.
In image classification, recognition, and other problems, a deep learning method can simulate how the human brain responds to images, and analyze the image data more thoroughly.

For example, Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, are commonly used in Deep Learning image classification. In this type of Neural Network, the output of the nodes in the hidden layers of CNNs is not always shared with every node in the following layer.16-Nov-2022
